# RecRep

*Event Stream Record and Replay Engine*

Record and replay datastreams from event based applications and infrastructures:

- Record one or several concurrent datastreams in one or more record jobs
- Create an inventory with reproducible test sets of recorded datastream windows
- Replay your recorded test sets in the same time sequence as they were recorded
- Replay your recorded test sets with various velocities
- Pluggable input and output endpoints
- Flexible mapping of input endpoints to recording
- Flexible mapping of recorded input endpoints to output enpoints for replaying
- Terminated record job windows
- Infinite record job windows with buffered rollover strategy
- Overlay and inject additional data streams to your recorded data stream on replay
- Ad-hoc or scheduled record job creation
- Ad-hoc or scheduled replay job creation
- Web-UI to control and monitor your record and replay job inventory 

## What is it for?

- Functional testing of event based applications and infrastructures
- Regression testing of event based applications and infrastructures
- Performance testing
- Reproducible simulation of event stream scenarios
- Continuous event recording for resiliency enhancement
- Audit event streams
